	<p>Hi, I'm Tolga - A digital product designer based in Amsterdam and currently working as a freelancer and studying
		in the meantime at HVA.</p>

	<h2>One Approuch to rule the all</h2>
	<p>
		Curiosity to sell and an obsession for anything related to innovation and design. This is the explosive mix that
		brought me here.
	</p>

	<p>
		am also an enthusiast systems designer. My favorite quote is:"Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will
		spend the first four sharpening the axe".
	</p>

	<p>
		I firmly belive that design is not just about aesthetics. It's about solving problems so that others don't have;
		It's about building something that lasts and works well, and use data to help people make better decisions than
		yesterday. It's about use technology to improve lives, but the software should be just one tool among many in
		the arsenal.

		This makes the difference between good and best-in-class products.
